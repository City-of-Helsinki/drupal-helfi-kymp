# Helfi KYMP district and project search

Helfi KYMP district and project search is a React app used as a UI for the search functionalities in drupal-helfi-kymp instance

To make most of this app, make sure you have installed the drupal-helfi-kymp project and have set it up properly.

## Getting started

First, copy .env.example to .env and add missing variables
```console
foo@bar:~$ cp .env.example .env
```
Start up the project
```console
foo@bar:~$ nvm use
foo@bar:~$ npm i
foo@bar:~$ npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

To run the tests:
```console
foo@bar:~$ npm t
```

## Developing

### Folder structure

As React has no standardized folder structure, and this app is pretty contained let's try to keep the folder structure simple. Group files to top-level folders by feature.

### SCSS

Styles reside in [HDBT](https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/drupal-hdbt) theme.

### Coding style

We have a pre-commit hook that runs through prettier.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run dist`

Creates a release-ready bundle from from the project.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project, so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you could not customize it when you are ready for it.
